# ansible-desktop-bootstrap

A quick-and-dirty collection of Ansible playbooks and roles for setting up an Ubuntu Desktop workstation. Nothing fancy here â€” just fast and pragmatic solutions thrown together to avoid forgetting what needs to be installed.

This repo is more of a personal cheat sheet for automating basic environment setup. Use at your own risk :)
